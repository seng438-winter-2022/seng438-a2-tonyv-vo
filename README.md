## **IMPORTANT NOTE**
The hamcrest-core-1.3.jar file that was included with the jfreechart-1.0.19.zip of Assignment2-artifact.zip from GitHub Classroom did not work when we tried to compile our tests. We found that using hamcrest-all-1.3.jar instead of hamcrest-core-1.3.jar fixed our compilation errors. Therefore, it is **essential** to use hamcrest-all-1.3.jar instead of hamcrest-core-1.3.jar. Please use the JARs found in [Reference Library](Referenced%20Libraries/) for the project buildpath rather than the ones provided from Assignment2-artifact.zip.
